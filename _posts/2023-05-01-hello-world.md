# Hello world!

Hi everyone! My name is Justice Calderón, I'm a Mechanical Engineer turned Software Engineer!

I'm starting this blog as a space to share my thoughts as I venture off into the world of growing my career in software engineering and computational sciences!

As for me, I am 26 years old with a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Delaware (go Blue hens!) and a Master of Science from the Univeristy of Colorado at Boulder (skoo buffs!). I studied Mechanical Engineering at both institutions.

So after putting time into an advanced degree in Mechanical Engineering, why am I choosing to switch into Computer Science and Software Engineering? Well buckle in, we're going to take a trip down memory lane... 

If I'm honest, I had a very non-linear path into engineering. Not only did I not know much about engineering, I didn't really understand differences between different fields and applications of each skillset (I mean, I was 17... can you blame me?).

My freshman year I struggled getting through the general engineering courses because I couldn't get past these fundamental questions stemming from, "What is the application of this?". I mean, why would I find sequences and series useful? Didn't I sign up for Mechanical Engineering to build stuff with hardware? Why am I in a chemistry course?

I just struggled to see the big picture. I'm sure I'm not alone on this, but these questions were definitely holding me back. I had to see what the power of engineering really is.

It wasn't until my Sophomore year during my Solid Mechnics course that I decided to take a deep-dive into what engineering is "all about". I joined a research group to study 2D Graphene using HPC (high-performance computing) tools. 

BOOM - it hit me. Suddenly, within a few months, I found my self in a candy store of using complex mathematics and code to simulate material properties to determine how we can tailor these characteristics to make an impact in today's world. I was inspired. 

Sound strange? Maybe... But I couldn't help it, I started to see the impact of tying all these subjects together to create a better future and quality of life for this world we live in. 

Additionally, not only did I see the big picture behind the mathematics and physics, I fell in love with the task of programming. Using the logic and reasoning math to simulate evolution of molecules or a computational state just gave me a sense of euphoria.

I know. NERD.

But you know what, that's okay. :)

Since then, I have taken every opportunity I could to just learn that much more about computers and programming. I've learning Python, Java, and JavaScript and I'm currently learning how to apply my programming knowledge to build applications and useful tools in freelance projects and industry!

Becoming a Software Engineer sounds like a tall task. And it is. From learning languages and frameworks to building projects. But it is definitely the most fun task I could ever ask for. 

To all the aspiring developers out there, cheers to you and cheers to shaping a better brighter future. 

Signing off!
